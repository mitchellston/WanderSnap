# WanderSnap

WanderSnap is a project made with C# Razor pages on which users can create adventures that are collections of photo's which the user took.

## Requirements

- SQLite database
- npm, yarn or pnpm

## Getting started

1. **Install node modules**

In the root folder use your preferred Node.js package manager to download the dependencies. (In my example I use pnpm)

```
pnpm i
```

2. **Create a SQLite database in the root folder**

The database.sqlite.sql file contains the schema which the database needs.

3. **Run the project**

Use the command below to start the project. (of course you can use your preferred package manager)

```
pnpm run dev
```
